# NABU
NABU Standalone

Preface
The NABU Computer system emerged in Canada in the late 70s and latest to the early 80s. Introduced with many other 8-bit computer systems of the time, this was unique in its relationship with the north-east cable company that offers pushed software titles; for entertainment and the home office. Pre-dating the Internet broaden availability in the early 90s, the NABU Computer system opened consumers up to remote downloaded offerings.

In November 2022, a release of "new" old stock was put on the market through ebay, and these 40 year old systems gained new life in the retro community; including with those who were affiliated and familiar with the system back then.

This GitHub page offers an exploration into the system as a standalone system and a guide to other avenues of being explored and supported.

My personal intent is to explore the following directions
- Customer ROM replacement
- Option card integration 
- Hardware system customizations
